- **We are listening to the players:** we know that the priority must be the quality of use that our users will have on our platform. So, in the last week, we focused on collecting feedback from the community to implement improvements in ScoreMilk.

- **Platform security:** Another crucial point of our work is being to thoroughly analyze every detail of our system to ensure that it is 100% protected from any threat.

- **Security audit:** in view of these points, we are talking to major digital security companies, with more than 20 years of experience, to carry out a complete audit on our platform to attest to its reliability and robustness.
